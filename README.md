# Adding Reference
There are two ways of referencing StbTrueTypeSharp in the project:
1. Through nuget: `install-package StbTrueTypeSharp`
2. As submodule:
    
    a. `git submodule add https://github.com/StbSharp/StbTrueTypeSharp.git`
    
    b. Now there are two options:
       
      * Add StbTrueTypeSharp/src/StbTrueTypeSharp/StbTrueTypeSharp.csproj to the solution
       
      * Include *.cs from StbTrueTypeSharp/src/StbTrueTypeSharp directly in the project. In this case, it might make sense to add STBSHARP_INTERNAL build compilation symbol to the project, so StbTrueTypeSharp classes would become internal.
